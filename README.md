### About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at Texas Tech with a Math minor, actively building software in C, Python, and Java.

My focus is on how low-level logic and algorithm design power higher-level intelligent systems — from lexical analyzers and syntax parsers to parallel cellular simulations and dynamic programming problems.

Currently preparing for graduate studies in Artificial Intelligence, I'm exploring how compilers, algorithm efficiency, and symbolic reasoning tie into real-world AI foundations.

### Projects

- [**Lexical Analyzer**](https://github.com/maxheitzman/Lexical-Analyzer)  
  Built in C. Scans source code and classifies tokens like keywords, operators, and identifiers.

- [**Syntax Parser**](https://github.com/maxheitzman/Syntax-Parser)  
  Handwritten recursive descent parser for validating language structure using BNF grammar rules.

- [**Multiprocessor**](https://github.com/maxheitzman/Multiprocessor)  
  Two-phase cellular automaton simulator with both serial and parallel Python implementations using multiprocessing.

- [**QuickHybridSort Analysis**](https://github.com/maxheitzman/QuickHybridSort-Analysis)  
  Analyzes performance of a hybrid QuickSort/InsertionSort algorithm. Benchmarks crossover threshold and visualizes runtime behavior.

- [**0/1 Knapsack Zoo Trip**](https://github.com/maxheitzman/Knapsack-ZooTrip)  
  Solves the 0/1 knapsack problem using bottom-up dynamic programming. Selects optimal items for maximum biodiversity under weight constraints.
