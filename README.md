### About Me

I'm a Computer Science student with a Math minor, currently building projects in Python and C.  
I focus on how low-level logic powers high-level systems — from custom language compilers to cellular automaton simulators.

### Projects

- [**Lexical Analyzer**](https://github.com/maxheitzman/Lexical-Analyzer)  
  Built in C. Scans source code and classifies tokens like keywords, operators, and identifiers.

- [**Syntax Parser**](https://github.com/maxheitzman/Syntax-Parser)  
  Handwritten recursive descent parser for validating language structure using BNF grammar rules.

- [**Multiprocessor**](https://github.com/maxheitzman/Multiprocessor)  
  Two-phase cellular automaton simulator with both serial and parallel Python implementations using multiprocessing.
