# Max Heitzman

I'm a Computer Science student with a Math minor, currently building projects in Python and C. I focus on how low-level logic powers high-level systems â€” from custom language compilers to cellular automaton simulators.

## Projects

- [Lexical Analyzer](https://github.com/maxheitzman/lexical-analyzer)  
  Built in C. Scans source code and classifies tokens like keywords, operators, and identifiers.

- [Syntax Parser](https://github.com/maxheitzman/syntax-parser)  
  Handwritten recursive descent parser for validating language structure using BNF grammar rules.

- [Multiprocessor](https://github.com/maxheitzman/multiprocessor)  
  Two-phase cellular automaton simulator with both serial and parallel Python implementations using multiprocessing.
