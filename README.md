## About Me

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from Texas Tech University with a Math minor, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I bridge the gap between complex technical systems and business needs — designing scalable solutions while effectively communicating with both technical teams and stakeholders.

My strength lies in translating intricate technical concepts into clear, actionable insights. Whether leading a capstone project team, coordinating multi-agent AI systems, or designing database architectures, I excel at both the technical implementation and the people-facing aspects of software development.

I'm passionate about roles where I can leverage my technical depth (from low-level systems to modern AI/ML) while working directly with clients, stakeholders, and cross-functional teams to deliver impactful solutions.

**Key Strengths:**
- **Technical Depth**: Full-stack development, AI/ML systems, database design, system architecture
- **Communication**: Explaining complex concepts in layman's terms, technical documentation, stakeholder presentations
- **Leadership & Coordination**: Team leadership, project coordination, cross-functional collaboration
- **Problem Solving**: System design, optimization, translating business requirements into technical solutions
